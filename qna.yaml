- question: What is the definition of an AI system according to the AI Act?
  answer: |
    An AI system is software that is developed with one or more of the techniques and approaches listed in Annex I and
    can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations,
    or decisions, that influence physical or virtual environments.
- question: What are the main components of an AI system?
  answer: |
    An AI system consists of a training phase, an inference engine, and a knowledge base. The training phase involves
    learning from data, while the inference engine generates outputs by reasoning on the knowledge base. The knowledge
    base represents entities and logical relationships relevant for the application problem through formalisms based
    on rules, ontologies, or knowledge graphs.
- question: What are the types of AI systems?
  answer: |
    AI systems can be classified into two categories: narrow or weak AI systems, which are designed to perform a
    specific task, and general or strong AI systems, which can perform any intellectual task that a human being can do.
- question: What is the role of data in AI systems?
  answer: |
    Data plays a crucial role in AI systems, as they learn from vast amounts of data to understand the structure and
    context of language without explicit instructions about what each piece of text is about. Models can therefore
    learn and generalize their understanding of the world and are capable to handle new and diverse situations.
- question: What are the risks associated with AI systems?
  answer: |
    There are several risks associated with AI systems, including unintended consequences, bias, transparency,
    accountability, and privacy issues. These risks can have significant societal and economic impacts, and it is
    essential to address them through appropriate regulations and safeguards.
- question: What is the role of the European Parliament and the European Commission in the AI Act?
  answer: |
    The European Parliament and the European Commission are working together on the development of the AI Act, which
    aims to lay down harmonized rules on artificial intelligence in the European Union.
- question: What is the purpose of the AI Act?
  answer: |
    The purpose of the AI Act is to ensure that AI systems are safe, transparent, and accountable, and that they
    respect fundamental rights and values.
- question: What are the key provisions of the AI Act?
  answer: |
    The AI Act includes several key provisions, such as the obligation for providers to draw up and make publicly
    available a sufficient summary of the content used for training general-purpose AI models, the establishment
    of an EU-wide list of high-risk AI systems, and the possibility for the European Commission to adopt delegated
    acts to further specify certain aspects of the regulation.
- question: What are the consequences of non-compliance with the AI Act?
  answer: |
    Non-compliance with the AI Act can result in administrative fines, prohibition of the AI system, and other
    penalties.
- question: What is the role of copyright law in the training of general-purpose AI models?
  answer: |
    Copyright law plays a role in the training of general-purpose AI models, as it requires providers to draw up and
    make publicly available a sufficient summary of the content used for training the model. This summary should
    include a list of the main data collections or sets that went into training the model and a narrative explanation
    about other data sources used.
- question: What is the purpose of the AI Office in the AI Act?
  answer: |
    The AI Office is responsible for providing technical assistance, advice, and guidance to stakeholders on all
    aspects of the AI Act.
- question: What are the categories of AI systems according to the AI Act?
  answer: |
    The AI Act recognizes two categories of AI systems: narrow or weak AI systems, which are designed to perform a
    specific task, and general or strong AI systems, which can perform any intellectual task that a human being can do.
- question: What is the role of the European Commission in the development of the AI Act?
  answer: |
    The European Commission is responsible for proposing the AI Act to the European Parliament and the European
    Council, and for implementing the regulation.
- question: What are the transparency requirements for AI systems according to the AI Act?
  answer: |
    AI systems must be transparent and explainable, and providers must provide clear and comprehensive information
    about the AI system, including its purpose, the data used for training and testing, and the methods and
    techniques used for developing and deploying the system.
- question: What are the accountability requirements for AI systems according to the AI Act?
  answer: |
    AI systems must be accountable for their actions, and providers must be responsible for ensuring that the AI system
    is used in compliance with the regulation. This includes implementing appropriate governance structures, such
    as risk management mechanisms, monitoring systems, and complaint handling procedures.
- question: What are the privacy issues associated with AI systems?
  answer: |
    AI systems can raise privacy concerns, as they often rely on large amounts of personal data. Ensuring the
    protection of personal data and respecting data subject rights is an essential aspect of the AI Act.
- question: What are the biases in AI systems according to the AI Act?
  answer: |
    AI systems can perpetuate and amplify existing biases, as they learn from data that may contain inherent biases.
    The AI Act aims to address this issue by requiring providers to take appropriate measures to avoid, minimize, or
    eliminate biases in AI systems.
- question: What are the unintended consequences of AI systems according to the AI Act?
  answer: |
    AI systems can have unintended consequences, such as harm to individuals or society, or negative impacts on the
    economy and the environment. The AI Act aims to address this issue by requiring providers to take appropriate
    measures to avoid, minimize, or eliminate unintended consequences of AI systems.
- question: What are the transparency requirements for AI systems according to the AI Act?
  answer: |
    AI systems must be transparent and explainable, and providers must provide clear and comprehensive information
    about the AI system, including its purpose, the data used for training and testing, and the methods and techniques
    used for developing and deploying the system.
- question: Which entities does the AI Act apply to?
  answer: |
    The AI Act applies to both public and private actors, including developers, importers, and buyers of AI systems,
    located both inside and outside the EU. However, it does not apply to AI systems used solely for military, defense,
    or national security purposes, or to research, development, and prototype activities preceding the release on the
    market.
- question: What are the regulations for general-purpose AI models?
  answer: |
    Providers of general-purpose AI models are required to disclose certain information to downstream system providers
    and implement policies to ensure compliance with copyright laws. Some models may pose systemic risks due to their
    capability or widespread usage, and the AI Office may update the threshold for determining these risks.
- question: How does the AI Act regulate biometric identification?
  answer: |
    Real-time remote biometric identification by law enforcement authorities is subject to prior authorization by a
    judicial or independent administrative authority, except in urgent situations. Post remote biometric identification
    requires prior authorization by a judicial authority or independent administrative authority. Biometric
    identification systems must meet certain accuracy standards and cannot discriminate based on race, sex, religion,
    etc.
- question: How do the rules protect fundamental rights?
